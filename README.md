# install_nsrl_tools
A script to instal NSRL checking tools and database

This is a script that leverages the great work of:

* Robert J. Hansen: https://github.com/rjhansen
* Jesse Kornblum: https://github.com/jessek

Specifically, this script installs and builds the latest versino of his NSRL tools and the NSRL RDS minimal database

I'm currently writing this.  When done (readme will be updated).  I expect to only test this on Ubuntu
