# install_nsrl_tools
A script to instal NSRL checking tools and database

This is a script that leverages the great work of:

Jesse Kornblum

Specifically, this script installs and builds the latest versino of his NSRL tools and the NSRL RDS minimal database

I'm currently writing this.  When done (readme will be updated).  I expect to only test this on Ubuntu
